# JapaneseVocabularyGenerator
Store the vocabulary you want to memorize in Dictionary.tsv. The code will generate an mp3 file that says all of your vocabulary. Listen to it over and over again for memorization. Optionally include Dictionary_Focus.tsv to make an additional one. I use this one to be a smaller list that I really want to focus on.
